## Hello there, I'm Dimas Kuncoro Jati ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate Statistics graduate with advanced statistics and programming skills. Proficient in data cleaning, visualization, analysis, and creating machine learning models to tackle complex problems. My expertise extends to data engineering, pipeline, and warehousing in AWS, Azure, and GCP to architect data solutions. Driven by a passion for growth and challenges, I actively participate in boot camps and competitions to continually expand my skills. Remarkably, I led a team to secure 2nd place in a national big data competition showcasing my teamwork, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. I am actively seeking a challenging role where I can apply my skills and make an impact.
